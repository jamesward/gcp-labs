## Objective
I am interested to build labs for GCP so that I can dive deeper, share the experience with others. 

While Terraform works well to declare infrastructure state in HCL, the bash script with `gcloud` from SDK is great and indenspenable to learn natively.  

## Format
Ideally each lab should have at least:
* `create.sh` to create all the resources
* `cleanup.sh` to clean up all the resources
